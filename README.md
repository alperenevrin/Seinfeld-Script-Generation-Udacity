# TV Script Generation

In this project, we'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  We'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Please check the dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb file for the details and the work.
